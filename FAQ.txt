A few resources to help

2. Flask introduction youtube tutorial:(best to start from Part1)

3. Needed:
i)python3
ii)flask. To test if you have flask:
a. Pull up terminal
b. type: python3
c. Python opens.
d. type: import flask
e. If you get no errors, you have flask installed. If error, you need to install it. See this tut for help(see #1 above) 

iii) requests
a. Pull up terminal
b. type: python3
c. Python opens.
d. type: import requests
e. If you get no errors, you have requests installed. If error, you need to install it.  
*Note about requests package on cs3 server:
[Gilberto: On cs3, I've confirmed flask is installed for python3 ( 3.5, 3.6)
However, requests package is not installed on python3 - Only works when using python2.7. 
*Flask not on 2.7, so we have a conflict. We will need requests installed on python3. Need to talk to instructor (He'd mentioned requests was installed but I've verified its not:
Steps:
cs3$:
python3
import requests
>>>ImportError: No module named 'requests' 
]
Update: talked to instructor and requests is working on cs3 now :)
So we are good on flask and requests working on cs3 python3.5
